I'm a Bachelor of Computing co-op student at the University of Guelph currently studying computer science.

The following contains a brief overview of my experience."),n.createElement("h2",{style:u},"About Cast"),n.createElement("p",null,"Cast was a social media company founded in 2020 located in the heart of downtown Toronto. It was primarily a mobile application that ran on both Android and iOS. The app's main core concept was built around social voting that allowed people to share their opinions on various topics and have people vote on those topics anonymously. These topics could range anywhere from social issues to politics to sports and even dating. Whatever was on someone's mind, they could ask it and people around the world could vote on it. Since Cast was founded during the Covid-19 pandemic, the company was remote-first by default but had an office downtown Toronto where employees could meet, hang out, and discuss strategy. I ended up visiting the office twice. Once to meet with the engineering team to discuss preliminary plans for the development of Cast V2, a newer and sleeker version of the app, and another to meet with the entire team right before the official launch of V2 at the end of the summer. The company also held two early morning daily standups over Google Meet, one for the engineering team, and one for the marketing team. On top of that, there were also weekly one-on-one meetings with each member of the team, meaning that each person would meet with every other person on the team virtually at least one time per week. This allowed each team member to discuss in-depth details of what they were working on to keep everyone in the loop. Unfortunately, the company folded in November of 2021 due to budgetary reasons and concerns that the app was not growing as fast enough as the founders had hoped."),n.createElement("h2",{style:u},"Job Description"),n.createElement("p",null,"I was originally hired on with the company to do software QA. This would entail both manually testing the app as well as writing automated unit tests. The job quickly transitioned into more of a software engineering role as I took on more and more software-related tasks on top of the testing work I was doing at the time. This entailed working on the frontend mobile application using React Native, working on the backend using Node.js in conjunction with both a Postgresql database as well as Google Firestore. Some of the projects I worked on at Cast include, but are not limited to, revamping user profiles for Cast V2, building out the re-cast feature for users to re-cast other peoples casts, building the expiring cast feature that enabled users to set a time on their casts when people are no longer allowed to vote, and building out admin dashboard tools for better reporting and analysis to improve user experience."),n.createElement("h2",{style:u},"Goals"),n.createElement("p",null,"During my time at Cast, I developed 6 learning goals.

This would not only make me a valuable contributor to the engineering team at Cast but also any future company that I work with that uses React. Overall, I ended up seeing my React skills grow tremendously and was able to obtain a solid grasp of the core concepts.

If the other person comes from a non-technical background, it’s important not to use too much unnecessary technical jargon that just ends up confusing them. It’s better to break something down into simpler terms that they can understand.

For example, I went from having limited knowledge of how “join” queries work, to being able to write pretty advanced join queries by the end of my term. This allowed me to take queries that were being split up into chunks, combine them into a single query using joins, thus reducing the latency of the HTTP requests utilizing those requests, sometimes by an order of magnitude.
